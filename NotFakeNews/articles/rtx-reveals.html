						&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; So in back September 2018 the RTX 20 series cards from NVIDIA has launched, at that time we could not use RTX on the video. But now, at CES 2019 NVIDIA launched the RTX 2060 and we were able to use RTX on that video. Here is what it revealed!!!

					<h3>
					This week at CES 2019, NVIDIA launched the "budget friendly" RTX 2060. You are not able to see much from the video, but once you turn #RTXOn it reveals much more.
					<br>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Are you ready for <img src="../static/images/rtxon.png" width="100px" height="50px">? &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Here we go...
					</h3>

					<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; So #RTXOn turns on RTX for the whole image it revealed Jensen's shiny head and instead of him holding the RTX 2060, its a stack of money! So what this basically means is that RTX reveals more than just Ray tracing! It reveals the truth! The RTX 2060 is priced at $349 USD which is just way overpriced but compared to the RTX 2070 and 2080 its actually a pretty good deal. If thats too expensive for you(most of us...) there are rumors that NVidia is also planning to launch a GTX 1160 lets just hope its not *Too* expensive.
					<br>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; The RTX 2060 can actually keep up with the GTX 1070 and surprisingly most of the time is faster than it! So if you buy it now you are paying $20 USD less and getting more performance. But for most of us lets just hope there is a GTX 1160. Currently the RTX 2060 is the best price to performance ratio from the RTX line up. So if you REALLY need that fancy RAY Tracing and cannot live without #RTXOn the RTX 2060 is your best option, Getting GTX 1070 like performance while having the freedom of turning #RTXOn.
