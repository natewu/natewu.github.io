						Youtube's most subscribed Youtuber since August 15th, 2013 is about to get taken over by Indian music company T series!
						What can you do to save youtube? Well you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pewdiepie?sub_confirmation=1"><b>DO YOUR PART!</b></a>
						<br>In October 2018, Pewdiepie was predicted to get overthrown by T Series in November. But thanks to all the people doing their part and Youtuber <a href="https://youtube.com/mrbeast6000">Mr. Beast<a> he remained in the top spot! He also became the first person to cross 68 Million, 69 Million, 70 Million, 71 Million, and 72 Million Subscribers in the history of Youtube and he did it all UNDER A MONTH!		
						<br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Even Pewdiepie's viewers in India are promoting him with pictures of themselves holding up signs to Subscribe to Pewdiepie or posting advertisements in public places. (Pictures below are from Bangladesh and India)

						&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; People doing their part is helping a lot, but the amount of people in India getting internet for the first time and the only Youtube channel they know about is T Series is closing the gap very quickly. 
						Pewdiepie is currently holding a 200k gap from T Series and we must DO OUR PART to save youtube from T Series taking over!
					</p>
					<p>&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; As of Dec. 5th 2018 a lot of youtubers stepped up and live streamed to support Pewdipie, we are now at a 500k Gap! Keep it going! <br> On Dec. 4 2018 Pewdiepie did a charity live stream to raise money for CRY India's 9 year olds. He and his 9 year olds raised a total of over 200k to support children in India!</p>
